abstract="Over the years, injection molding has been a premier manufacturing technique in the production of intricate polymer components. Its molding efficiency rests on the shoulders of multiple process and machine parameters, which dictate the final product quality in terms of multiple output responses. It is imperative to state that a precise optimization of various input parameters is paramount for achieving the desired quality indices. In this article, a review of different techniques employed till date for optimizing various injection molding parameters is presented along with their advantages and limitations. It is found in the review that a complete intelligent technique operable without human interference is yet to be developed.",

Various plastic injection molding process parameters, such as mold temperature, melt temperature, injection time and injection pressure are considered. The hybrid strategy combines numerical simulation software, a genetic algorithm and a multilayer neural network to optimise the process parameters. An approximate analysis model is developed using a Back-propagation neural network in order to avoid the expensive computation resulting from the numerical simulation software. According to the characteristic of the optimisation problem, a nonbinary genetic algorithm is applied to solve the optimisation model. The effectiveness of the improved strategy is shown by an example.              ",
